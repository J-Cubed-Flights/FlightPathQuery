# J-Cubed-Flights
Removed unique_carrier, Flight Number, and all the delays from the transport_data_2015_january.csv file.
## How to use
To use the GUI, download the 'data' folder and the GUI executable that is found in the root directory.
Then run the executable. If the flights do not show up, you can go to 'options' in the top left corner of the GUI and select the folder that contains the data files.
